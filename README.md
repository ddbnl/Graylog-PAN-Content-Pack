# Graylog-PAN-Content-Pack

Graylog content pack for Palo Alto firewalls. The dashboards are based on an previous content-pack for Palo Alto that went 
out of date. The extractors have been generated dynamically using Palo Alto documentation as reference 
(using a script located here: https://gitlab.com/fastwalker/Graylog-Extractor-Template-Generator).

Extractors can probably be simplified. Feel free to make a pull request to fix/improve something.

This content pack contains:
- Input;
- Stream;
- Extractors for THREAT and SYSTEM category logs;
- Dashboards for threats and URL filtering.
